<br>    
As part of the prosecution case, a former student filed an affidavit of rape she had committed. To prevent this from being published he used harsh threats against her, including using criminals who blackmailed her severely, as a result she retracted her testimony. Rav.Laitman of "Kabbalah La'am" tried to evade testimony regarding a sexual assault that was allegedly silenced in the "Kabbalah La'am" movement, claiming that it was dangerous for him to enter the hall due to his health condition and fear that he would be infected with Covid-19.
<br>
After showing the judge pictures he posted when he met people as if there was no Covid, the judge denied his request to testify on video.

The links and photos (below) show us what journalist Gur Megiddo published publicly on his Twitter and without fear of being accused of libel (as is customary in the Bnei Baruch organization) …
<br>
This information confirms the judge's conclusions in which Michael Laitman tries to avoid testifying in court, but the judge rejects his attempt to testify by zoom and obliges him to appear in court, in a lawsuit that will end soon and a verdict will be that Bnei Baruch is a cult.

Much more shocking and horrifying is a phenomenon in which married women or spouses of his students provide Laitman with a sexual outlet!
<br>
These acts were told to Ilanit Izarski, who was also a student in the organization and served as a psychologist and social worker in Bnei Baruch, as part of Ilanit's psychological treatment of the victims of the horrific phenomenon.
<br>
Ilanit even appeared in court in this matter, but due to professional confidentiality the names of the victims remained confidential, but we are here to publish the truth about what is happening in Bnei Baruch.
<br>

Many times we have heard that "Rav" Laitman is a humble, God-fearing man, and yet his students never dare to ask the next thing?
<br>
He lives in a 3-storey private building with a pool, sauna, private Jacuzzi and young maids (Sveta Romanov). Is it called a modest life?
<br>
Do his students know that for all the many conferences around the world to which he flies with a suitable entourage for a prime minister who cooperates with his heinous sexual acts, luxurious rooms, suites and servants are always waiting for him to be cared for mainly by women as personal assistants who take care of all his needs ...
<br>

Aryeh Makarevich (his bodyguards) rents a luxurious hotel for Laitman with a bed of 3 by 3 meters to satisfy minimal and modest desires…

Here are some significant and appalling highlights from the testimonies below:

"When I approached Laitman and we started talking in person (below) he would tell me 'I am the one who will bring you to the Creator.'
However, he sometimes said "without me you will not be able to feel the Creator" or: "I am within you because I am on a higher spiritual level and you can only feel the Creator through me". He said he was my conduit to the Creator. "

"I remember that next to the conference Jacques Douieb (https://www.facebook.com/jacques.douieb) he told me that Laitman asked to see my picture and after seeing the picture he confirmed my role as his assistant. His wife, Noam Douieb (https://www.facebook.com/douieb.noam) also repeated these things to me during the Congress."

"Then he said I could go to his room in the evening so I could ask him questions."

"I was shocked. I told my friend M. that Laitman invited me to his room. M. was shocked and told me, 'If what I think is right, I intend to leave the group.' She told me not to go to his room."

"I told Aryeh Makrevich (https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000598045600) that I was married. He did not answer. He did not explicitly say that Laitman wanted to sleep with me but he hinted at that fact."

"I told Laitman that I did not understand how he could sleep with a married woman and I told him that if he wanted to sleep with me then we should be married. According to Kabbalah, a woman's path to spirituality is only through her husband. Laitman just laughed and said we would not marry."

"When I was with him he told me explicitly that he wanted to have sex with me. I hoped I could please him without having sex with him. I offered to give him a massage. He asked me: 'Do you think I have a problem with women?'. "Laitman has certain physical characteristics that I will not detail here so as not to infringe on his privacy beyond demand but I can describe them if I ask about it."

"The next day he invited me again. He wanted to sleep with me again but he did not have an erection. He asked me to perform oral sex on him but I was not able to do it. He got angry and kicked me out of his apartment."

# Testimony given by a foreign resident who was a follower of Bnei Baruch regarding a sexual assault she experienced from Michael Laitman in 2014:

<ol>
<li>
In 2011 I lived in France. I came across Laitman's classes online and felt he was giving answers to all my questions. I felt like all my life I was looking for the ways to the Creator and he was the first to say exactly what I wanted to hear. I began to hear his lessons intensely.
</li>
<li>
For the first few months, I only listened to classes online. I watched classes on kab.tv all my free time and attended online courses. When Laitman was the lecturer of the Kabbalah lessons, I could not help but listen to him. At the same time, none of the other teachers at Bnei Baruch had a similar influence on me.
</li>
<li>
After a few months I felt the need to meet people who were also in the group, in light of what Laitman would always say during his classes that a person can feel the Creator only through interaction with the group, with the “friends”.
</li>
<li>
I started attending dinners, "mirror" congresses and holiday meetings at the Bnei Baruch group in France.
</li>
<li>
I also joined a "virtual group" in my home country. The group received its instructions from Bnei Baruch group member in Petah Tikva, Jacques Douieb, who served as a coordinator between the inner group and our group. The general group would convene for a (virtual) meeting once a week; We also worked in a committee: a reception committee, a book committee, etc.
<br>
which we would also convene virtually for meetings during the week.
</li>
<li>
Jacques Douieb would translate Laitman's morning classes simultaneously… I would listen to the morning class every day on the Kabbalah-Media website, not in real time (at night) but during the day.
</li>
<li>
I volunteered to devote all my time to translating Bnei Baruch's texts (books, websites, Laitman's blog, etc.) from France, in order to allow French speakers to read them.
</li>
<li>
My husband was also interested in Kabbalah. Despite this, he never appreciated Bnei Baruch or Laitman. He did not like the fact that I spent so much time volunteering for them. I could not accept the criticism he passed on my son Baruch.
</li>

# Laitman's status in my eyes at that time

<li>
Laitman taught us that the Creator is within the group. Sometimes he would ask the group a question and tell us not to use the mind but to connect with the group and find the answers at the center of the group during the workshops. I felt that the group was just repeating Laitman's words and I was not convinced of the spiritual development. In those times I did not dare to criticize him but thought to myself that Laitman was close to the Creator and that there was no chance that he was wrong.
</li>
<li>
When I approached Laitman and we started talking in person (below) he would say to me "I am the only one who will bring you to the Creator". However, he sometimes said "without me you will not be able to feel the Creator" or: "I am within you because I am on a higher spiritual level and you can only feel the Creator through me". He said he was my pipe to the Creator.
</li>
<li>
When I listened to his voice in class his voice made me very calm and peaceful. I felt a sense of pleasure. Laitman is very confident and charismatic and when he spoke I felt he had answers to all my questions. Sometimes when he called me on Skype (below) my hands were tingling.
</li>

# The visit to Israel and the personal acquaintance with Laitman

<li>
In 2014, I arrived in Israel for the Congress of the Book of Zohar. Before that I did not know Laitman personally. I felt I adored him and he was my teacher but I did not know him.
</li>
<li>
During the conference, Jacques Douieb invited Bnei Baruch's French speakers to the conference - about eight members of the virtual group as well as French-speaking Israelis - for a personal meeting with Laitman in his apartment in the Bnei Baruch Center in Petah Tikva. During the session we gathered for a group photo and Laitman shook his head at me, as if inviting me to stand close to him.

![](images/6.png)

</li>
<li>
During the congress, there was talk that a few months later, another Bnei Baruch congress would be held in Europe.
</li>
<li>
When I got home, at the first working meeting after the conference, Jacques Douieb informed us that the next congress would be held in my country of residence! Our job was to organize the conference: find a place, arrange transportation, refreshments, etc.
</li>
<li>
The French team was considered one of the worst teams of Bnei Baruch - it had a high dropout rate, there were not many members, and we were not able to produce activities as expected of us. It was very difficult for us to prepare for the Bnei Baruch congress. We would talk about it but we knew it was unrealistic.
</li>
<li>
I was very involved in organizing the Congress.
</li>
<li>
In preparation for the congress, Jacques Douieb Mail informed all members of the group that I had the honor of being the assistant of the Rav. in the congress. I was very excited and happy. The opportunity to meet and serve the Rav. was like a dream come true.
</li>
<li>
I remember that after the conference Jacques Douieb https://www.facebook.com/jacques.douieb told me that Laitman asked you to see my picture and after seeing the picture he confirmed my role as his assistant. The wife of Jack, Noam Douieb https://www.facebook.com/douieb.noam also repeated these things to me during the congress.
</li>
<li>
As Laitman's personal assistant, I was given the task of preparing Laitman's table during the conference - bringing him water, making him tea, bringing him anything he needed. Likewise, I arranged the room for him (I put water, yogurt, etc.) together with Noam Douieb before his arrival. Before Congress, an assistant named R. Who was an assistant to the center of Bnei Baruch's European group, sent me the Laitman's list of requirements - all the things that needed to be prepared for him (yogurt, some water, etc.). I remember that Laitman's assistant, S., asked for mineral water of a type that did not exist in France and I was very embarrassed that I did not meet Laitman's requirements (Laitman himself later told me that he did not attach any importance to the type of mineral water). I remember talking about it with group members and one of the companies that lived close to the border suggested she go to the neighboring country to buy the kind of water he asked for. We did not think of not respecting his demands, even the smallest of them.
</li>
<li>
We were all willing to do anything for him because we were grateful to Him because we thought He would teach all of humanity how to connect with the Creator.
</li>

# The convention was in my country of residence.

<li>
As part of the preparations made for the conference, we booked accommodation in a kind of cottage on the congress website. Laitman is placed in the room with his bodyguards - Michael Snilevich https://www.facebook.com/michael.sanilevich - the husband of his daughter and a guy 
named Arie Makrevich. 
</li>
<li>
When they arrived at the conference he asked to put the bodyguards in a separate room, next to his room.
</li>
<li>
When Laitman came to the convention site I showed him his room (and the yogurt, water, etc.) and he started asking me questions about myself. It was the most exciting moment of my life. The person I admire the most in the world talks to me for 15 minutes!
</li>
<li>
Then we all went to his lecture. My duties during the lecture were to bring him a drink when needed.
</li>
<li>
After the lecture there was a meal. After the meal, alI went up to him and asked him if he needed anything more. He asked me if I had any questions about Kabbalah. I replied that of course I have (for me he was the person who could answer all my questions!). Then he said I could come to his room in the evening, so I could ask him questions.
</li>
<li>
I was shocked. I told my friend M. that Laitman invited me to his room. M. was shocked and told me: "If what I think is right, I intend to leave the group." She told me not to go to his room. 
</li>
<li>
I accepted her offer because I did not want to know if what I was afraid of was true. I could not afford to be disappointed in him. I told myself I must be wrong about his intentions; But, even if there is a small risk that I am right, it is better not to take the risk. I did not even dare to tell myself explicitly what I was afraid of.
</li>
<li>
The next morning when I arrived at the Congress Hall I saw him. I offered him coffee and he responded aggressively: "I do not need anything from you!".
His reaction was so harsh that I almost tripped.
</li>
<li>
Noam Douieb, Jacques Douieb's wife, came over and asked me what happened because Rav. told her that he did not want me to make him coffee anymore, and that he wanted N to make him coffee from now on. I said I did not know and started crying. I sat during the lesson and cried. I could not explain to N. why Laitman was angry with me. I think I understood in a sense why he was angry with me but I also could not fully admit to myself.
</li>
<li>
I was very confused because I felt immense admiration for him.
</li>
<li>
His "bodyguard," Makrevich, approached me and asked me what had happened. I said, the Rav. was mad at me. He invited me to go for a walk and started talking about being married but sometimes he sees a woman he likes and that's fine. He hinted to me that it's okay for a married man to sleep with other women. He also said that Laitman looked very angry in the morning when Makarevich saw him and that he had never seen him in such a situation before.
</li>
<li>
I suspected that in his words he was actually hinting to me that if I slept with Laitman, it would be a completely normal act - but I did not believe it could be true because of my admiration for the Rav. I hoped I was wrong.
<br>
Makarevich told me that Rav. chose me to serve as an assistant during the congress because he saw my picture. He said Laitman chose me and did not want N. to serve him coffee because she has dark hair and loves blondes. 
</li>
<li>
I told Makarevich that I was married. He did not answer. He did not explicitly say that Laitman wanted to sleep with me but he hinted at that fact. 
</li>
<li>
I was afraid to approach Laitman so I asked Makarevich to tell Laitman that I did not come at night to talk to him because I did not want to endanger Laitman's reputation, so that he would stop being angry with me.
</li>
<li>
Towards evening I saw Laitman smiling at me. I approached him and he asked if I really did not come so as not to harm his status. I explained that I did not come to him so as not to endanger his reputation because there were many of his students in the place who could have thought inappropriate thoughts - the compound is small and there were a lot of group members, I did not want people to think wrong about him… I was too scared to try and find out if my fears were true.
</li>
<li>
In the evening the members of the group brought him presents - sweets and similar things. Laitman wondered where to put the presents and I suggested putting them in my car because the congress hall was far from the rooms. Makrevich approached me and told me to bring the sweets to Laitman's room at night.
</li>
<li>
At night I went to his room with the presents and knocked on the door very quietly, hoping he would not hear. I thought to myself: this is how I can say the next day that I came and you did not open for me. He did not hear or open, and the next day he went back to Israel.
</li>
<li>
On the last day of the congress, I asked Laitman if I could come to Israel in the summer for a few weeks to volunteer at the center. I felt the need to contribute to Bnei Baruch and contribute more to my group. He replied in the affirmative.
</li>
<li>
After returning to Israel Laitman began to act as if he had fallen in love with me. He started calling me on Skype and he sent me emails. He told me he likes to call me on Skype and watch me on video camera.
</li>
<li>
I felt great joy. I did not like him as a man: he is old and ugly. However, I loved him as my teacher and as my contact to the Creator. He told me that I have special spiritual qualities, that I am special and that he will help me progress in my spiritually.
</li>
<li>
Laitman made me feel special and important. He said that I could help a lot with translation at the Bnei Baruch Center. I began to ponder the transition to the Bnei Baruch Center in Petah Tikva. My dream was to work at the center. This is because at the time I believed that the work of dissemination in Bnei Baruch was the best way to serve the Creator.
</li>
<li>
I still felt full of gratitude and admiration for him as a spiritual teacher. He was the most important person in my life.
</li>
<li>
I arrived in Israel in 2014. I arrived in Petah Tikva from the airport around one in the morning. A friend of Bnei Baruch came to pick me up from the airport. Laitman called me after I landed and invited me to come and say hello right away. I stayed with group members close to the Bnei Baruch Center. When I arrived, I asked my host, V. L., to show me where the center was because I wanted to say hello to the Rav. V. told me that Laitman was sleeping and at that moment it was impossible. I told him that the Rav. was waiting for me. He did not believe me that I had such a personal connection with the Rav, but in the end he was convinced and took me to the center.
</li>
<li>
When we arrived at the apartment of the Rav. (in the center) Laitman was awake and expecting me. Laitman told him that now he and I had to work. V. stayed in the center and waited for me in case I wanted to go home.
</li>
<li>
I hugged Laitman and felt he wanted something beyond the hug. He started putting his hands on me and tried to kiss me. I was disgusted and rejected him. I told him I could not now. He did not insist and said: “Well, you are tired now. See you tomorrow". The meeting lasted about 15 minutes. I called him and we went home.
</li>
<li>
The next day I brought him gifts I had brought for him from my country. He tried to sleep with me again and I refused. Aside from the fact that I was not interested, I just could not understand how a man on such a spiritual level would allow himself to violate the prohibition on sex outside of marriage and adultery (since I was a married woman). I told myself that if my mission on the path to spiritual transcendence is to marry Laitman then I must do so. I thought if he wants me as his wife then he knows the right way for me. Although I did not want him as a man, I was ready for this sacrifice for the good of the Creator. 
</li>
<li>
I told Laitman that I did not understand how he could sleep with a married woman and I told him that if he wanted to sleep with me then we should be married. According to Kabbalah, a woman's path to spirituality is only through her husband. Laitman just laughed and said we would not get married.
</li>
<li>
Laitman told me he was my channel to the Creator. He used other Kabbalistic terms (the step above you), which meant that my only way to be enlightened was through him. That is, in order to receive enlightenment (to progress spiritually) I had to serve him and cancel myself.
</li>
<li>
After I rejected him and when he realized that I was not ready to sleep with him, he began to use psychological manipulations on me. He ignored me and then the next day he showed a lot of affection. He realized I was addicted to him. After a few days he traveled to Sochi, Russia for a few days to a conference on integral education.
</li>
<li>
I was very confused. I still adored him very much but I wanted a spiritual and not romantic connection with him.
</li>
<li>
I started working on translating his lectures. The atmosphere at the center was very different from what I expected based on Laitman's stories. According to Laitman's description, I used to think of them as my family. But when I was at the center I did not feel love among the friends at the center. I felt hatred. I was very surprised. It used to be the best place in the world: the place where everyone loves and cares for each other. It's hard for me to explain but I felt rejected by the other group members. I have seen that relationships between group members are based on hatred. I felt very lonely there. I kept working on translations because I wanted to feel useful. I was also very surprised by the way Laitman treated my Bnei Baruch friends who worked at the center. He often screamed at them, cursing and using obscene words, etc. I felt sorry for them because they must have felt very humiliated.
</li>
<li>
When Laitman returned from Russia he continued to manipulate me psychologically: he completely ignored me for a few days and then suddenly gave me attention and invited me to his office (in his apartment inside the center, next to his bedroom) to talk about the translations.
</li>
<li>
When I was with him he told me explicitly that he wanted to sleep with me. I hoped I could please him without sleeping with him. I offered to give him a massage. He asked me, "Do you think I have a problem with women?" 
</li>
<li>
I also saw his wife once. She lived elsewhere, outside the center. When I asked him about her he said they had not lived together for twenty years.
Eventually, as a result of the psychological state I was in, I agreed to have sex with him. The thought of him ignoring me was too painful. I felt that if he continued to be angry with me I could not continue to exist. I thought to myself that if the only thing that will satisfy Laitman is my body then I must sacrifice my body for its pleasure. I wanted to give of myself (to bestow) and to give up one hundred percent. I considered having sex with him as an act of influence towards the Creator.
</li>
<li>
One evening I arrived at his apartment and we had sex. It was disgusting for me. I was just waiting for it to end. It was awful. He convinced me not to use a condom and told me "do not worry, you will not get pregnant". Laitman has certain physical characteristics that I will not detail here so as not to infringe on his privacy beyond demand but I can describe them if I ask about it. The same goes for the skin problem he suffers from. I choose not to disclose details here in order not to infringe on his privacy beyond demand but I can provide details about it if I ask. I was very disgusted with him and his body.
<br>
I agreed to sleep with Laitman only because of his spiritual status and because I saw him as my spiritual leader. I would never have agreed to do this without these reasons. I did this because I admired him so much and could not come to terms with the idea that he would be angry with me. In retrospect, I felt that he forced me to do so using psychological manipulations, and that he took advantage of the trust I had in him.
</li>
<li>
The next day he invited me again. He wanted to sleep with me again but he did not have an erection. He asked me to perform oral sex on him but I was unable to do it. He got angry and kicked me out of his apartment.
</li>
<li>
I went to my room and felt very sick. My fever went up, my head hurt a lot. I usually suffer from low blood pressure. V.'s wife checked my blood pressure and it was very high. I laid in bed for two days. Laitman did not contact me again.
</li>
<li>
I was supposed to stay in the center for two weeks but, given what I had just experienced, I could not stay there anymore. I called my husband and told him about what had happened. I asked my husband to advance my flight back home and I flew ten days later instead of two weeks.
</li>

# After returning to my country

<li>
The night after I returned home. I did not understand what was happening to me. I felt completely broken. As if I had lost everything I had, as if my life had exploded. I remember looking in the mirror and wondering how I looked whole when I was so broken inside. I had suicidal thoughts and at the same time I had a weird feeling that I could not even commit suicide because I was already dead. I remember that for the first few days I was very scared to be left alone. I asked my husband to stay with me at home. I felt in a vacuum - like I did not know where the floor was. It is very difficult for me to explain the feeling in retrospect.
</li>
<li>
I told myself that there was probably a flaw in my conduct and that I was to blame for something. Kabbalah was everything to me and I could not have imagined life without it. I felt I could not breathe without the Kabbalah. On the other hand, I could not listen to Laitman anymore.
</li>
<li>
I did not tell anyone in my group why I came back early. I said my family was worried because there was tension with Gaza at the time. I sent an email to the group members saying that I should distance myself from the group for a while and I thanked them for understanding.
</li>
<li>
Of the group members, I only told M. (a member of the group) what really happened. She was amazed by the story. We both did not know what to do as we were unable to separate Laitman from the Kabbalah. We felt the light from Kabbalah but Laitman was a monster.
</li>
<li>
I still wanted to study Kabbalah but did not know how. I had no one to talk to about it. About ten days after I returned home I wrote to a person I knew from Bnei Baruch, P. Which I greatly appreciated. I wrote to him that I wanted to study Kabbalah but that I knew Laitman closely and that he was a monster. He asked me if it had anything to do with sex, and I said yes, something like that. I asked him how to proceed. He advised me to ignore what happened to Laitman and continue to study, and that I would "cross the barrier" if I continued my studies despite what happened to him.
</li>
<li>
During the first month after I returned I tried to listen to Laitman's lessons again and found that I was incapable. I told myself that it could not be that the light would come through such a bad person. I did not understand why I no longer believed in his things. I felt doubt in his words. Before what happened I believed in Laitman more than I believed in myself.
<br>
For the first few weeks after I returned, Laitman and I did not correspond. After about a month, I listened to his lecture and wrote to him that I seemed to have returned to Bnei Baruch. I was hoping he would give me answers: I asked him what happened and why it happened that way. 
<br>
He replied that he was very happy for my return and that he regretted everything that had happened, that everything had happened through his own fault and that he hoped we would forget everything that had happened and we would move on. He said that in the future I would know why everything happened the way it did.

I tried to get involved again in Bnei Baruch's activities. I listened to online classes and helped prepare for the next European Congress by translating the congress website and joining the registration team, but I felt skeptical about Laitman and could now see that he had erred in his interpretation of some of the sources of Kabbalah. I was asked to translate Laitman's program that was published on YouTube on the subject of "Secrets of the Eternal Book" - I began to notice that some of Laitman's interpretations of the Torah were different from Rabash's interpretations. I no longer blindly believed in Laitman.

# The connection with M. and the disengagement from Bnei Baruch

<li>
Some time later I virtually knew M.. M. and I have been friends on Facebook for a long time, as I automatically approved requests from friends from Bnei Baruch. I had about two thousand friends, most of whom I did not know.
</li>
<li>
One day I came across a critical post on Facebook that M. wrote about Bnei Baruch. It was the first time I had seen a critical post about Bnei Baruch from a real person with whom I was able to make contact, and who did not seem crazy or unreliable, but one who seemed to know what he was talking about. I contacted him and asked him if it was possible to study Kabbalah without Laitman.
</li>
<li>
This was the first time I saw a critical post about Bnei Baruch. I have never seen critical opinions regarding Bnei Baruch before from a reliable internet source. For this reason I have always felt that if I feel that something in Bnei Baruch is not true, it was my problem and this problem was rooted in me. Laitman would always say that if we identify something that is not true within the group, then the blame for that is within us.
</li>
<li>
M. and I began to correspond. After a while I told him what had happened to me. He was the first to understand me and helped me a lot and supported me. M. also studies Kabbalah without Laitman and he was able to show me how to study Kabbalah without Laitman's interpretation.

After I left, I realized that the Bnei Baruch group was very close to me. I realized that I was not working at all for the Creator but for a self-interested organization trying to control people and especially for Laitman who used my spiritual aspirations to fulfill his carnal lusts. I felt that they had abused my trust in them.
</li>
<li>
After I lost contact with Bnei Baruch, I hardly wrote about them on the Internet. I have no feelings of revenge or hatred towards Laitman. In retrospect, I am happy about what happened to me because if Laitman had not hurt me I would never have left the organization.

# The woman who gave this testimony was willing to testify in court, but despite her confidentiality, the details were leaked to people who wanted to prevent her from testifying and threatened her life and the lives of her family, and the woman eventually announced she would not testify against Michael Laitman.
