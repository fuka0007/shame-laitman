Here are some significant and appalling highlights from the testimonies below:

"When I approached Laitman and we started talking in person (below) he would tell me 'I am the one who will bring you to the Creator.'
However, he sometimes said "without me you will not be able to feel the Creator" or: "I am within you because I am on a higher spiritual level and you can only feel the Creator through me". He said he was my conduit to the Creator. "

"I remember that next to the conference Jacques Dave (https://www.facebook.com/jacques.douieb) he told me that Laitman asked to see my picture and after seeing the picture he confirmed my role as his assistant. His wife, Noam Dave (https: // www.facebook.com/douieb.noam) also repeated these things to me during the Congress. "

"Then he said I could go to his room in the evening, so I could ask him questions."

"I was shocked. I told my friend M. that Laitman invited me to his room. M. was shocked and told me, 'If what I think is right, I intend to leave the group.' She told me not to go to his room."

"I told Aryeh Makarevich (https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000598045600) that I was married. He did not answer. He did not explicitly say that Laitman wanted to sleep with me but he hinted at that fact."

"I told Laitman that I did not understand how he could sleep with a married woman, and I told him that if he wanted to sleep with me then we should be married. According to Kabbalah, a woman's path to spirituality is only through her husband. Laitman just laughed and said we would not marry."

"When I was with him, he told me explicitly that he wanted to have sex with me. I hoped I could please him without having sex with him. I offered to give him a massage. He asked me: 'Do you think I have a problem with women?'. "Laitman has certain physical characteristics that I will not detail here so as not to infringe on his privacy beyond demand but I can describe them if I ask about it."

"The next day he invited me again. He wanted to sleep with me again but he did not have an erection. He asked me to perform oral sex on him but I was not able to do it. He got angry and kicked me out of his apartment."
